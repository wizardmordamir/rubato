/**
 * Promotion-gate decision logic (PURE — the impure git/build/taskq wiring lives in
 * the `~/.taskq` watchdog that imports these).
 *
 * The orchestration keeps an **always-green main**: workers churn on each repo's
 * `refactor/integration` branch (where intermediate-broken, cross-repo states are
 * tolerated), and a recurring cross-repo gate only ever advances `main` by
 * **fast-forwarding it to a verified-green integration** — so the owner's localhost,
 * which runs off main, never sees a broken build.
 *
 * A repo's integration is "promotable-green" on TWO independent signals, both of
 * which must pass: the **build** (`bun run build` of the integration worktree — the
 * type/bundler gate) AND a lightweight **runtime boot smoke** (boot the consumer's
 * server against an isolated home/port and hit `/api/health`). The smoke catches
 * runtime-only breaks a green build misses — a missing-export crash on boot, a bad
 * dynamic import — so a build that compiles but won't run can never promote `main`.
 * The smoke is per-repo OPTIONAL (a provider with no server to boot has none); see
 * `repoGreen`/`RepoState.smokeGreen` for exactly how it gates.
 *
 * This module answers, given each repo's `main`↔`integration` ancestry and whether
 * its integration build (and runtime smoke) are green, what the gate should do:
 *
 *  - **promote**  — ff `main` → `refactor/integration` (integration is ahead AND the
 *                   WHOLE system is green). This is the only path that moves main.
 *  - **catch-up** — ff `refactor/integration` → `main` (main is ahead; integration is
 *                   strictly behind it). Always safe — integration is the churn branch
 *                   and main is the trusted/green tip — and it re-syncs the two so the
 *                   next round of work builds on top of main. Never moves main.
 *  - **hold-red** — integration is ahead but NOT green (or the system isn't all-green):
 *                   do NOT promote (would risk main); a heal task fixes integration first.
 *  - **diverged** — main and integration each have unique commits: neither can ff.
 *                   Needs manual/heal reconciliation; the gate only logs it.
 *  - **none**     — already in sync (equal tips).
 *
 * Promotion is gated on the ENTIRE system being green ("the apps run together"), not
 * just the one repo — promoting one repo's main forward while a sibling's integration
 * is red could land a main that depends on an unpromoted sibling change. catch-up is
 * not system-gated: it only ever moves the (untrusted) integration branch.
