# Integration worktrees & first-party symlinks

This repo (and its siblings) drive a multi-app refactor where individual tasks may
land **intermediate-broken** states. To keep the owner's localhost — which runs off
each repo's default branch (`main`/`master`) — **always green**, that churn happens
on a parallel `refactor/integration` branch in a dedicated worktree, and the
first-party dependencies (`cwip`, `cursedbelt`) are wired with **real symlinks** so a
change in one is always live in the others — never a stale registry copy.

## Layout

All four repos live as direct children of `~/code/github`, with the default checkout
and an `-integration` worktree side by side:

```
~/code/github/
  cwip/                       master            ← provider (consumed via dist)
  cwip-integration/           refactor/integration
  cursedbelt/                 main              ← provider (consumed via source)
  cursedbelt-integration/     refactor/integration
  cursedalchemy/  (ca)        main              ← consumer (cwip via dist)
  cursedalchemy-integration/  refactor/integration
  rubato/         (ru)        main              ← consumer (cwip dist + cursedbelt source)
  rubato-integration/         refactor/integration
```

Each worktree has its **own `node_modules`** (a git worktree does not share the
default checkout's gitignored `node_modules`). Run `bun run setup` in a fresh one.

## How first-party deps resolve

| dep | consumed as | linked where (in ru) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cwip` | built package (`./dist/...` exports) | `node_modules/cwip` **and** `ui/node_modules/cwip` |
| `cursedbelt` | **source** (`source` export condition → `./src`) | `node_modules/cursedbelt` only — `ui/` resolves up to it; a `ui/node_modules/cursedbelt` would break the vite peer-dedupe |

A provider's `dist` must be built for a `dist`-consumer to typecheck (`bun run build`
in `cwip*/`, `cursedbelt*/`). Source-consumed `cursedbelt` needs no build for ru.

## The symlink guard — `scripts/relinkFirstParty.ts`

`cwip` is pinned `^2.0.1` in `package.json` so rubato stays publishable, but that
means a bare **`bun install` resolves the published cwip and writes a real directory
copy** over the symlink — reverting the repo to a stale cwip. (That is the bug class
that broke `main`.) `cursedbelt` is `link:`ed, but a global `bun link` only ever maps
the name to **one** checkout, so it can't tell `main` apart from an integration
worktree.

The guard writes **direct, variant-aware, relative symlinks** itself, bypassing both
the registry copy and the global link:

- A checkout whose directory ends in `-integration` links to the sibling
  `<dep>-integration` builds; any other checkout (default, a feature worktree) links
  to the plain `<dep>` builds. So integration resolves integration, main resolves
  main — a first-party change is always live, never cross-contaminated.
- The sibling "hub" dir is found by walking up, so it works at any worktree depth
  (incl. a nested `rubato-worktrees/<slug>`).

It runs automatically as:

- **`postinstall`** — guards every `bun install` (restores the symlink bun just
  clobbered);
- the tail of **`scripts/setup.ts`** — covers `ui/`'s separate install;
- **`bun run relink`** — manual one-shot fix.

It is zero-dependency and best-effort: if a sibling is absent (publish/CI) it no-ops,
and a failure warns without failing the install. **You no longer need `bun link cwip`
after setup** — the guard does it, correctly, per variant.

## Verifying

```bash
# in any checkout — symlinks must resolve to the right variant
bun run relink
ls -l node_modules/cwip ui/node_modules/cwip node_modules/cursedbelt
bun run tsc      # root typecheck — proves cwip resolves
```

`main` resolves `../../cwip` (+ `../../../cwip` for ui); `refactor/integration`
resolves `../../cwip-integration`. The ui typecheck (`cd ui && bun run tsc`) may carry
unrelated in-flight cursedbelt-migration errors — those are *missing-member* errors
(the module resolved), not *module-not-found*, so they don't indicate a wiring break.

## The worker flow & the promotion gate

The orchestrator (`taskqDrain` → `claudeExecutor`) spawns each task agent in the repo's
main checkout, and `buildWorkerPrompt` directs the **integration flow**: a worker
branches its task worktree **from `refactor/integration`** (named `<slug>-integration`
so the symlink guard resolves the integration builds), verifies its **own** repo, and
merges **back to `refactor/integration`** — never `main`. Cross-repo or whole-system
breakage on integration is tolerated; a heal task fixes it later. `main` is never
touched by a worker.

`main` only ever advances through the **promotion gate** — the version-controlled
`src/scripts/integrationGate.ts` (launchd job `com.taskq.mainhealth`, every ~10m;
evolved from the old untracked `~/.taskq/main-health-watchdog.ts`). Each idle cycle it:

1. Classifies each repo's `main` ↔ `refactor/integration` ancestry.
2. **Builds** the integration worktrees that are ahead (providers `cwip`/`cursedbelt`
   first, so consumers `ca`/`ru` resolve their fresh integration dist — the cross-repo
   "apps run together" check). This is the TYPE/bundler gate.
2b. **Runtime boot smoke** — after a green build, boots each smoke-configured consumer
   against an **isolated state dir + a free port** and waits for a healthy `/api/health`
   (`ru` → `rubato-serve`, `RUBATO_HOME`/`RUBATO_PORT`), then tears it down. This catches
   runtime-only breaks a green build misses — a missing-export crash on boot, a bad
   dynamic import — so a build that *compiles* but *won't run* can never promote `main`.
   Bounded by a timeout and isolated, like the rest of the gate.
3. **Promotes** (`git merge --ff-only` `main` → integration) only when the **whole
   system** is green — where "green" now means BOTH the build passed AND the runtime
   smoke didn't fail — so `main` never advances to a broken-OR-unbootable state. It
   **catches up** the reverse (ff integration → `main`) when `main` is ahead, and
   **holds** (no promote) when any repo's integration is build-red or boot-red.
4. Spawns ONE deduped **`heal-<repo>-integration`** task per red/diverged repo, on the
   integration flow, then kicks the drainer. The heal body distinguishes a build failure
   from a boot-smoke failure ("BUILDS but won't BOOT").
5. After promoting, rebuilds the providers' main `dist` and re-relinks the consumer
   main checkouts so localhost (which runs off `main`) stays current.

The gate is layered for review + test:

- **`src/server/taskq/promote.ts`** — the PURE promote/ancestry decision core
  (`decideSystem`/`decideRepo`/`ancestryFrom`, plus `repoGreen`/`healReason` for the
  runtime-smoke gate), unit-tested in `promote.test.ts`. A repo is promotable-green iff
  its build passed AND its boot smoke didn't fail (`RepoState.smokeGreen`; `undefined` =
  no smoke ran → never blocks).
- **`src/server/taskq/bootSmoke.ts`** — the impure runtime boot smoke
  (`rubatoSmokeSpec`/`planSmoke`/`runBootSmoke`), reusing cwip/testing's hardened
  spawn+health-poll. Pure plan + an impure runner that boots a consumer against an
  isolated home/port, waits for health, tears it down, and NEVER throws (a boot failure
  is `{ ok:false }` + the log tail). Unit-tested in `bootSmoke.test.ts`; a functional
  test boots the REAL `rubato-serve` through it.
- **`src/server/taskq/gate.ts`** — the IMPURE git/build/heal wiring (`runGate`). It
  imports only `node:*` + the zero-import pure core, so the gate still loads/runs when
  the rest of rubato (or cwip) is mid-broken — and shells out to the taskq CLI rather
  than importing `cwip/taskq` for the same resilience. The taskq board, launchd kick,
  logging, **and the boot smoke** are all INJECTED seams (`GateOptions.runSmoke`), so
  gate.ts never hard-imports bootSmoke (→ cwip/testing) — preserving its resilience —
  and `src/test/integration/integrationGate.int.test.ts` exercises the real
  git/build/smoke/ff/heal wiring in-process against throwaway temp repos (ported from
  the old `~/.taskq/verify-intgate.ts`).
- **`src/scripts/integrationGate.ts`** — the thin launchd entrypoint (mirrors
  `taskqDrain.ts`). It wires the real `runSmoke` via a **guarded lazy import** of
  bootSmoke (so a mid-broken cwip/testing degrades to the build-only gate instead of
  crashing the entrypoint). `--dry` decides + logs without mutating; `--print-launchd`
  emits the `com.taskq.mainhealth` plist (pointing at this repo file); the repo set +
  `TASKQ_HOME` are env-overridable (`MAINHEALTH_REPOS_JSON`/`MAINHEALTH_NO_KICK`) for an
  isolated run.

> **ca's runtime smoke is a follow-up** (`fu-intgate-smoke-ca`): its multi-workspace boot
> needs an isolated `CA_DATA_DIR` + `PORT` (and a `caSmokeSpec` mirroring `rubatoSmokeSpec`)
> verified in the ca repo first. Until then ca stays build-only (its `runSmoke` returns
> `null`) so an unverified smoke can't freeze the system-gated promotion.

**Cutover from the old untracked watchdog** (once this file is on each repo's `main`):
regenerate the plist from the repo and reload it —
`bun run src/scripts/integrationGate.ts --print-launchd > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.taskq.mainhealth.plist`,
then `launchctl unload … && launchctl load -w …`. The label is unchanged, so it
replaces the old job in place.

### Three green signals: build → boot → render (anti white-screen)

A repo's integration is only promotable-green when ALL of these hold — each catches a
failure the previous one can't:

1. **`bun run build`** — the bundle TYPE-checks + BUNDLES.
2. **Runtime boot smoke** (`src/server/taskq/bootSmoke.ts`) — boot the server on an
   isolated home + free port, wait for `/api/health`. Catches a build that compiles but
   crashes on boot (a missing export, a bad import at startup).
3. **Headless render smoke** (`src/server/taskq/renderSmoke.ts`) — **build the SPA**
   (`web:build`, cached — the gate's `bun run build` only builds the LIB dist, NOT the
   `ui/dist` SPA, so without this the server would serve a non-SPA fallback that reads as a
   false white screen), boot it, and drive a HEADLESS browser at it (Playwright in a `node`
   subprocess — `render-smoke-host.mjs`), asserting the **React root actually mounted**
   (non-empty) with **no fatal console errors / uncaught page exceptions**. This is the only
   signal that catches a **WHITE SCREEN**: two React copies from a `resolve.dedupe` gap (→ a
   null hook dispatcher), a runtime mount throw, or a missing context provider — all of which
   a green build + a healthy `/api/health` sail right past. Because it builds the SPA, it ALSO
   catches a UI that won't bundle (a `web:build` failure = RED), which the gate's lib-only
   `bun run build` never exercises. (This hardens against the incident where ru white-screened
   with `tsc` passing.)

Each smoke is folded into the repo's green signal at the wiring layer (`integrationGreen
&& smokeGreen !== false && renderGreen !== false`): a check that **can't run** (no helper /
no browser / server didn't boot) is INCONCLUSIVE and **never blocks** (it degrades to the
signals it does have); only a check that **ran and failed** holds promotion and arms a
`heal-<repo>-integration` task (build / smoke / **render** flavoured). Both smokes are
imported **lazily + guarded** so the gate keeps running even if a helper is absent.

The per-repo `renderSmoke` (and `smoke`) configs are OPT-IN: **ru** is on; **ca** stays
build+boot-only until its render smoke is verified in-repo (`fu-intgate-smoke-ca`), so an
unverified spec can't freeze the gate. `renderSmoke.ts` ships ru/ca presets
(`rubatoRenderSmokeSpec` / `caRenderSmokeSpec`) and is fully unit-tested with injected
server + browser seams (`renderSmoke.test.ts`) — no real browser in the suite.

> **Live vs. version-controlled gate.** The runtime boot + headless render smokes currently
> live in the LIVE launchd job (`~/.taskq/main-health-watchdog.ts`); `gate.ts` (the cutover
> target) does **not** carry them yet (its `runGate` is synchronous; the smokes are async).
> **Both smokes must be ported into `gate.ts`/`integrationGate.ts` before the cutover above**,
> or the cutover would silently drop boot + render gating. `renderSmoke.ts`/`bootSmoke.ts`
> expose the injectable cores ready for that port. (Tracked as a follow-up task.)

### Per-task UI verification + the dedupe guardrail (prevention)

The promotion gate is the backstop; two earlier layers stop a white-screen from getting
that far:

- **Worker prompt** (`claudeExecutor.buildWorkerPrompt`) — a **UI-touching** task (anything
  under `ui/`, a page/component, the vite config, or a first-party dep its bundle pulls in)
  is told that `tsc` + a green build are NOT enough and must run `rubato-render-smoke`
  (`bun run src/scripts/renderSmoke.ts`) and confirm it's GREEN before marking done. The
  same `runRenderSmoke` core backs both the worker check and the gate, so they agree on
  what "renders" means. (A render auto-revert is deliberately NOT wired into the false-done
  gate — a browser flake must never revert real work; the promotion gate is the enforcer.)
- **Dedupe-completeness guardrail** (`src/lib/viteDedupe.ts` + `viteDedupe.test.ts`) — a
  pure check that an app's vite `resolve.dedupe` covers EVERY required React subpath
  (`react`, `react-dom`, `react-dom/client`, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react/jsx-dev-runtime`)
  plus recommended context libs. A missing subpath — `react/jsx-dev-runtime` especially —
  white-screens ONLY in dev (dev compiles JSX via `jsx-dev-runtime`, prod via `jsx-runtime`),
  which a prod-bundle render smoke can't see. The guardrail runs against ru's own
  `ui/vite.config.ts` as a test, so a regression fails the gate; the pure checker is
  reusable by the cross-repo anti-drift guardrails (`fu-guardrails-enforce`).

The checks above prove a UI **runs**. They cannot prove it was **re-thought** — a green
`tsc` + build + render smoke pass just as readily on a faithful re-skin of the old app. So a
task that designs or builds a UI surface (the shell/nav, the page domains, ru adoption, and
all future UI work) also runs the **UX anchoring critic** — an adversarial status-quo-bias
gate that flags every way the design still mirrors the pre-refactor app and demands a bolder,
north-star-realizing alternative for each, passing only when no anchoring or clear improvement
remains. Run it at design time (before building) and again before landing, after the scoped
engineering gate is green. Spec + runnable: **`UX_ANCHORING_CRITIC.md`** →
`tools/critics/uxAnchoringCritic.mjs` (bar: the UX north-star). It is the design analogue of
`q-code-review-gate`: that one proves the diff is correct, this one proves it escaped inertia.
